## Getting Started

First, install all the dependencies with yarn:

```bash
npm install -f
```

Forcing is required due to a trivial dep mismatch. MUI currently expects React 17, but Next requires React 18. Something something javascript.

Second, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Do not use yarn right now. PNP makes life hard.

## Run the codezzzz

Open [URL of your running environment]/proxy/3000 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

You can order as much as you want! It's on the house!
